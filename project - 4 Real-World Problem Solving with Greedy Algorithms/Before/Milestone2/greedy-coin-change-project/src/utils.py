    STEP 1:
    Validate the coin denominations list.

    Instructions:
    - Check if all denominations are positive integers.
    - Raise a ValueError if the validation fails.

    Example:
    denominations = [25, 10, -5, 1] → Should raise ValueError
    denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1] → Should pass silently
