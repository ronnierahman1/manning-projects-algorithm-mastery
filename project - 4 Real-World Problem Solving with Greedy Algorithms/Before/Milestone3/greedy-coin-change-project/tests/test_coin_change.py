"""
Unit Tests for Greedy Coin Change Calculator.

In this milestone, you'll write comprehensive unit tests to ensure that your greedy_coin_change algorithm behaves correctly, handles edge cases, and manages errors gracefully.

You'll be using Python's built-in unittest framework.

# STEP 1:
# Import the necessary functions from your project files:
# - greedy_coin_change from coin_change.py
# - load_denominations and validate_denominations from utils.py

    A suite of unit tests for verifying the correctness of your greedy_coin_change function.

    Instructions:
    For each test method below, clearly define:
    - The input parameters (amount, denominations).
    - The expected result.
    - The assertion to check correctness.
