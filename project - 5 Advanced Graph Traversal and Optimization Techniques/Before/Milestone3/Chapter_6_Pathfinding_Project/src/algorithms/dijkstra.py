def dijkstra(grid, start, goal, cost_map):
    """
    Performs Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the optimal path from start to goal in a weighted grid.

    Args:
        grid (list of list of int): 2D grid (0 = walkable, 1 = wall).
        start (tuple): Starting coordinate (row, col).
        goal (tuple): Goal coordinate (row, col).
        cost_map (dict): Dictionary with cost for each cell (row, col) as key.

    # Step 1: Initialize a priority queue with (0, start)
    # Step 2: Initialize a visited dictionary to reconstruct the path
    # Step 3: Initialize a total_cost dictionary with start node cost 0

    # Step 4: While the priority queue is not empty:
    #   - Pop the node with the lowest cost
    #   - If it's the goal, break
    #   - For each valid neighbor:
    #       - Calculate new cost
    #       - If new cost is lower than previously recorded:
    #           - Update cost and add to the priority queue

    # Step 5: Reconstruct the path and return it along with total cost
