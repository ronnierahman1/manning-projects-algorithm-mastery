# Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Overview**

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible along each path before backtracking. Unlike BFS, DFS dives into one path fully before exploring alternative paths.

## Key Concepts
- Uses a stack structure (LIFO) for traversal.
- Does not guarantee the shortest path.
- Excellent for exploring all possibilities and complex maze-like environments.

## Key Concepts
- Visits deeper nodes first, backtracks when no further nodes are available.
- Useful for exhaustive searches and path discovery.

## Use Cases
- Maze solving and puzzle games.
- Detecting cycles in graphs.
- Analyzing connectivity and component identification.
