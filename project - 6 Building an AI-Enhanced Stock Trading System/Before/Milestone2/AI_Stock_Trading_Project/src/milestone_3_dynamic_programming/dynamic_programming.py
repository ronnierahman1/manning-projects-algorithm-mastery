    Instructions for maximize_profit function:
    
    1. If the input 'prices' (a pandas Series) is empty, return 0 immediately.
    
    2. Determine the number of prices (n = len(prices)).
    
    3. Create a numpy array 'dp' of zeros with length n. This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each index.
    
    4. Initialize a variable 'min_price' with the first element in 'prices'.
    
    5. Loop over the prices starting from index 1 to n-1:
       a) Update 'min_price' to be the minimum of the current 'min_price' and prices.iloc[i].
       b) Calculate the potential profit for day i as prices.iloc[i] - min_price.
       c) Update dp[i] as the maximum of dp[i-1] (the best profit until the previous day) and the current day's profit.
       
    6. After the loop, the maximum profit achievable is in dp[-1]. Return it as an integer.
