Milestone 2: Integrate Dynamic Programming for Context-Aware Responses

This module implements a dynamic context system that helps the chatbot recall recent user inputs
and respond intelligently using past interactions. It simulates dynamic programming principles
by caching answers and maintaining a rolling history of conversations.

        Steps to implement:
        1. Normalize the query using `_normalize_query()`.
        2. Store it in `response_cache` with timestamp and metadata.

        Returns:

        Steps to implement:
        1. Normalize the query.
        2. Look it up in `response_cache`.
        3. If not found, call `_fuzzy_cache_lookup()` to find close match.
