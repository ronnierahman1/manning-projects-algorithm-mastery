def optimize_budget(total_budget, categories):

    Optimizes allocation of extra funds (beyond the minimum expenses) using dynamic programming.
    
    The function distributes any funds left after covering the minimum expenses across various
    spending categories, with extra funds allocated based on each category's assigned priority.
    A diminishing returns utility function (utility = Priority Ã— (1 - exp(-x))) is used to
    balance the allocation: high-priority categories receive extra funds more effectively.
    
    Args:
        total_budget (float): Total available budget (income).
        categories (list of dict): A list where each dictionary represents a spending category.
            Each dictionary must include:
              - 'Category': Name of the category (string)
              - 'Minimum Expense': The minimum required expense (float)
              - 'Priority': A numeric value indicating the importance of extra allocation (optional, defaults to 1.0)
