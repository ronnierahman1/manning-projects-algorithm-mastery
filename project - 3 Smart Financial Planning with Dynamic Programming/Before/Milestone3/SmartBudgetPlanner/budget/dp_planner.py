    Optimizes allocation of extra funds (beyond the minimum expenses) using dynamic programming.
    
    The function distributes any funds left after covering the minimum expenses across various
    spending categories, with extra funds allocated based on each category's assigned priority.

    balance the allocation: high-priority categories receive extra funds more effectively.
